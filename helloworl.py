d - division
m - multiplication
a - Addition
s - subtraction

#string Method: the cool thing is you can chain the together.

# you can also do print(hello.upper)
#same thing with .lower 
#you use this with user inputs
#.capitalize just caps the first letter. Actually it fixes the grammar
#.count it will count the amount of letters in the string.
